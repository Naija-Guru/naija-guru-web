    content: `Let me tell you, life is a journey with many paths. Sometimes,
              you will walk on <b>smooth roads</b>, everything will be joyful, but other
              times, the path may be filled with challenges. That's why they say,
              no matter what happens, you must stay strong and never give up. As you
              persevere, you'll find that not every day will be easy, but the
              determination you carry in your mind will make the difficulties less
              burdensome. Whether in rain or sunshine, you must continue your journey
              because persistence brings better results. In the end, it doesn't matter
              how slow or fast you go, as long as you don't remain stagnant, you will
              reach your destination.`,

  //             over firewood, you're missing out. The aroma will make your stomach

  //             pepper soup and pounded yam with egusi. Indeed! Even <b>eba with okra</b>

  //             ingredients is remarkable. That's why foreigners are so eager to try
  //             our cuisine. If you're Nigerian and unfamiliar with these dishes,

    title: 'Lagos Traffic',
    content: `Anyone who has driven in Lagos traffic will understand it's a real
              challenge. You might leave home at 5am, yet arrive at work by 9am.
              It's often inexplicable. Drivers lack patience, everyone <b>honks
              unnecessarily</b>, bus conductors shout, and motorcycle riders drive as
              if they're in Formula 1. Street vendors look for customers to approach.
              Even when it rains slightly, everywhere becomes congested. The worst part
              is that you'll face the same traffic when returning home. But as
              Lagosians, we've developed resilience to this situation. We continue to
              manage it with enthusiasm.`,

    title: 'Family Dynamics',
    content: `In Nigeria, family matters are significant. From our parents to our
              extended family, everyone feels entitled to offer opinions on your affairs.
              If you want to marry, the entire community will help evaluate your
              potential spouse. If you <b>get promoted</b> at work, everyone will expect
              financial assistance. Your aunts will ask when you plan to have children
              if you've been married for two years. Your uncles will question why you
              haven't built a house in the village. The expectations never end. But
              simultaneously, these family members will support you when times are
              difficult. They'll prioritize your concerns when you need assistance.`,

    title: 'Nigerian Music',
    content: `Nigerian music has gained global recognition and it's significant. From
              Afrobeats to Amapiano, our artists represent us excellently. Wizkid,
              Burna Boy, Davido, Tiwa Savage, Tems - all have carried our flag to
              international platforms. The <b>beats we produce</b> now are so appealing
              that even foreigners dance to them in clubs. Previously, people abroad
              weren't very familiar with our music, but now, you can hear Nigerian
              songs on radio stations worldwide. It's evident that Nigerian music
              will continue to dominate for many years to come.`,
