I reject am. Papa Ifeanyi still dey sleep, dey snore with im mouth like basket. I no sabi haw I dey manage sleep wit the kind ringtone wey dey comot from im mouth every night, but once my head touch pillow like this, I don go… I don too work.

Ifeanyi still dey sleep for ground. Im sister too still dey sleep. See as she spread leg. I carry leg small-small make I no match dem as I begin dey pack my market tins. As I dey pack am dey go, na so my kpangolo drop for ground. Ifeanyi begin dey turn dey shake body, but Papa Ifeanyi? For where? That one with im generator for mouth. If I like make I break plate for im ear, e no go wake. I dey happy sey I no wake di pikin-dem. If not dem go slow my waka, begin dey ask for many tins.

I carry my bag start dey go market. As I komot for my dommot, I see sey Gloria don dey wash cloth for outside.

“Gloria, haw nau?”

“Mama Ify, I dey o. You don dey go shop?”

I no sabi di kind JAMB question wey she dey ask me. Shey she no see sey I carry load? Wich oda place I go dey go for early momo like dis? I dey wonder weda na di belle wey she carry wey make am to no sabi wetin dey happen again. Dis one go be number five wey she don born. Oga Calistus dey find boy. No be small wahala.

As I reach market, I see sey na me first reach market. Mummy Tope, my neighbor never reach. E better like dat. She too dey do. Once she reach like dis, na so-so cho-cho-cho she go dey do. I no mind to dey follow am talk small-small, but once she enter talk like this, she no dey fit stop. I be di kind person wey no too like talk. I fit siddon from morning till night just dey tink. But with di kind work wey I dey do, if I no talk, I no go see shi-shi. Di women for dis awa market too like gra-gra. Na only two option dey. Make yu fight gidigbo to find customer or make yu siddon dey look. Last-last wen hunger don tire yu, yu go carry yor load go village go dey look.

See wetin I dey talk, I don too tink forget mysef. Make I sharp-sharp arrange my market. Day don break finish.

As I dey arrange my tomato and my oda tins, na so Mummy Tope come. She bring ha pikin, Tope, come market today. Dat pikin get coconut head. She no fit keep nyash for one place. Na so-so wahala she dey cause for market.

“Mummy Ify, yu early today o”, na wetin Mummy Tope talk as she begin dey arrange ha tins. I just smile small, but for my mind, na blow I want give am. Wich day I no dey come shop early?

“Welcome o. Haw body?”

“Ah, we thank God… Tope, yu no go greet Mama Ify?”

Di mumu Tope just dey look me like sey I get shit for face. As di mama yeye, na so di pikin too yeye.

“No mind Tope jare! She no well. She bin get malaria. Na wai I say make she follow me.”

Na so she start her cho-cho-cho. I no sabi how she no dey taya. My own be sey na market I come sell. Make she dey talk dey go.

One don nak. People don dey komot from church. Market don dey full. Na dis time I dey like market. People dey waka up and down dey buy every-every. I dey like wen all dem big-big madam come market. I dey always look dia cloth. Na so-so fine-fine tins dem dey wear. I dey pray for di day wen me sef go komot for my motor, dey wear big madam cloth and shoe. Dis kind life go fit me well-well. E get one woman wey come buy onions from me. She buy plenty onions, kon say make I hold di change on top. Di tin sweet me well-well. E don tey wey persin dash me mony. I see as mummy Tope dey look me wit one kind eye. Na she sabi. Make she sef pray for better customer.

E no long before Ifeanyi come jam me for market. I dey always happy wen e come, becos wen e come, I dey quick sell my market. I no sabi the cream wey di boy dey use but I no dey complain. Na my good luck charm. I go see better money when day end.

Dem kon dey shout sey them dey find Tope. Tope ke? Wetin dat one don do now? Mummy Tope dey try cover am make di olokpa no see am. Na so Ifeanyi shout sey she dey hide under table. Di olokpa just push Mummy Tope go one side, drag Tope commot for under table. Dem talk sey dem dey arrest am. Sey she steal money from persin. Last-last, dem don nab am. No be today she start dey tiff. Mummy Tope start dey cry, dey beg dem sey make dem leave ha pikin. Dem no gree o. Tope just dey look. She no send.

For Sunday night, I dey make sure sey I don polish my shoe, make e shine well-well—na Papa teach me dat one. I go kon iron my shirt, make e stand gidigba, make di lines dem sharp. My hair nko? Baba Solo go don shape am for me on Saturday. I no dey cut am for Sunday becos if I leave am till Sunday, by Monday, all di line for wer di clipper cut me go still dey show. Na after JSS2 I learn dat one. I don upgrade.

“O boy, na three-two o. Di match sweet no be small. You fit come my side after. Dem go show am again for evening.”

“No wahala nau, we go see.”

Our school no far, and before we close eye open am, we don reach. I be class prefect. So wen I reach school, na gate I dey stand, make I for see as all di students dey enter. Anybody wey I see wit dirty uniform, or wey no wear di correct shoe or socks, na to send am go back house. I no dey take nonsense. Everybody sabi dat one. Na wai I dey always make sure sey my own uniform dey shine. Make nothing stain my white.

Emmanuel na my regular customer for dis gate. Something dey always miss for im uniform. If no be sey e wear wrong sandal, e go be sey e no wear socks, abi im shirt dirty. Di guy dey always do anyhaw. But today, as e dey walk come my side, I scan am see sey everything dey intact. E shock me o.

“Emma, shey na yu I dey see so?”

Di boy begin dey smile. “Senior Emeka, na me o. I no wan make yu send me go house today. In fact, I don buy new shirt. Yu no see as e white?”

“I dey see am o. You try no be small. Keep am up o. I no want send yu go house again.”

“No wahala, Senior Emeka. I don change”, he laugh as e dey waka go.

All di students wey pass, dem do well today. Abi we dey do sometin for school today wey I no know?

As I dey finish my duty for gate, time for assembly kon reach. For assembly, I dey stand wit my classmates for line. Principal begin address us. As usual, na my class collect.

“SS2 B!!! Una wahala don dey plenty. Di reports wey I don dey get don fill cup. I no go take all dis rubbish from una. Una wey suppose be example to di junior ones-dem. Instead, na una just dey make shame catch us. As from today, una dey on manual labor. All of una go cut di grass wey dey field. After dat one, una go clean all di toilets wey dey for dis compound. Once una do dat one finish, I go find anoda work give una”.

As class prefect wey I be, I no think sey dis punishment go reach my side. Na im I raise my hand, make I ask. Principal just clear me straight. “Di punishment na for yu too, Emeka. Everybody join for dis one”. Na so everybody begin laugh. I no just understand di man. Me wey be good student. Na even me tell di man di things wey some of my classmates-dem dey do. I don mess up. I go go meet am after assembly. After e read announcements, e talk sey assembly don end, make we dey go class.

My friend Femi begin dey waka wit me as I dey go class.

“Haw far nau? Wai princi go do yu like dat? E no sabi sey yu be prefect?”

“No mind am joor. I go go see am later. Hope sey yu dey okay.”

“I dey o. Hmm… e be like say yor girlfriend dey come o. Check back!” Femi dey smile as e dey talk am. I turn back see say Amara dey waka come. She no be my girlfriend but everybody sabi sey I like am. Na why dem dey always joke sey she be my girlfriend.

“Guy, she no be my girlfriend.” Femi just laugh waka leave me for der. Amara tap me for shoulder.

“Emeka, haw far?” Ha voice be like pap wey dem just komot from fire—e smooth die. I dey alway shy to follow am talk.

“I… I dey fine, Amara. How you… haw yu dey?” I dey sweat.

“I dey. I want sey make yu no vex as people dey laugh yu for assembly ground. Yu know haw e dey go.” She dey smile at me.

“Ah no, I no dey vex. No wahala.” I no sabi weda to put my hand for pocket abi to fold am for chest. Di whole thing just dey make my body do jiggy-jiggy. Me and Amara neva talk for long like dis before, na just greet I dey greet am.

“Emeka, wetin happen? Yu dey okay?” Amara begin dey tap me for back. Dis cough no stop. E remain small make I cough out my intestines. People begin gather us. Wich kain embarrassment be dis one?

“Senior Emeka, wetin happen?”

“Make somebody bring am water.”
